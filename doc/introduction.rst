Installation
============

To be able to use freetype python, you need the freetype library version 2
installed on your system.

Mac users
---------

Freetype should be already installed on your system. If not, either install it
using `homebrew <http://brew.sh>`_ or compile it and place the library binary
file in '/usr/local/lib'.

Linux users
-----------

Freetype should be already installed on your system. If not, either install
relevant package from your package manager or compile from sources and place
the library binary file in '/usr/local/lib'.

Window users
------------

You can try to install a window binaries available from the Freetype site or
you can compile it from sources. In such a case, make sure the resulting
library binaries is named 'Freetype.dll' (and not something like
Freetype245.dll) and make sure to place a copy in Windows/System32 directory.
